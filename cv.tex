% Résumé in LaTeX

% Compile to PDF via either of:
% - `xelatex cv.tex` on the command line
% - setting the engine used in Texifier (macOS application) to a non-builtin one
%   (as it seemingly cannot handle the fontawesome package for icons?)
% - any LaTeX engine and setup that works for you :-)

% TODO: optimize for a seamless export to HTML for the personal homepage using
% pandoc?
